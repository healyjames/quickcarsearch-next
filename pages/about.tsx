                    <p>Before you read on, a quick note from me, James (owner/maintainer of this project): I just wanted to say a big thanks for visiting the site and reading this - Just by being here, you&apos;re helping support the journey of quickcarsearch.io and are helping to keep this project going!</p>
                    <p>We blend a love for cars with cutting-edge tech, and bring users lightning-fast searches with no hassle â€” just results in the blink of an eye. No fuss, no overcomplicated UI and total transparency with what I&apos;m trying to acheive here. I want to help you find the absolute fastest possible car for whatever budget you have. Simple.</p>
                    <p>Working on quickcarsearch.io gets me to think about how I can best implement and really perfect important web development concepts like <a href="https://mailchimp.com/marketing-glossary/seo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SEO</a>, <a href="https://web.dev/articles/vitals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Core Web Vitals</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">site performance</a> as well as giving me the chance to use some of the latest and greatest technologies on offer. So not only can a I build a tool that folks really love, but I get to learn and develop my skils along the way.</p>
                    <p>I built this site using the latest version of <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">NextJS</a> (which runs with <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vercel</a> under the hood). Its hosted with GoDaddy and deployed with AWS amplify. There really is not much more to it - which is key principle I have when it comes to building this project out: <strong>simplicity is king</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, less of that boring stuff, go and enjoy the site! Its still a work in progress with plenty of features soon to be released but if you like it, you can donate here to help me out: <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=W24KWDR9GV7FJ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.paypal.com/donate</a></p>
                    <p>Cheers</p>
