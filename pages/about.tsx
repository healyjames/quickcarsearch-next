                    <h1>About</h1>
                    <p>Hey, welcome to quickcarsearch.io! I'm James, the person behind this project - a big fan of anything with four wheels and an engine with a background is in software development, user experience and graphic design. quickcarsearch.io is a project of mine which is the result of all the skills and knowledge I've picked up over the years. Before you read on, I just wanted to say a big thanks for visiting the site and reading this! Just by being here, you're helping support my journey and helping keep this project going.</p>
                    <p>The main aim of this project is to create something that helps your average petrolhead find out how quick they can go on a budget. No fuss, no overcomplicated UI and total transparency with what I'm doing here. I want to help you find the absolute fastest possible car for whatever budget you have.</p>
                    <p>I started this project for fun. I enjoy cars and I enjoy writing code so I put the two together, simple as that. It gives myself the opportunity to hone my dev skills and it allows me to really explore how to make a seriously fast, user friendly, good-looking and (maybe most importantly) useful website. Every decision I make here, I try and ask myself "does the user find any value in this?". Working on quickcarsearch.io gets me to think about how I can best implement and really perfect important web development concepts like <a href="https://mailchimp.com/marketing-glossary/seo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SEO</a>, <a href="https://web.dev/articles/vitals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Core Web Vitals</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">site performance</a> as well as giving me the chance to use some of the latest and greatest technologies on offer.</p>
                    <p>Quickly, while we're on the subject, for any techies out there reading this and wondering, I built this site using the latest version of <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">NextJS</a> (which runs with <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vercel</a> under the hood). Its hosted with GoDaddy and deployed with AWS amplify. There really is not much more to it - which is key principle I have when it comes to building this project out: simplicity is king. Don't overwhelm the user. Don't pump rubbish into the codebase. Don't make life difficult for yourself! </p>
                    <p>What really sets this apart from the rest is the lightning-fast search functionality I've created. To be totally transparent about how we achieve lightning fast search results; we preload all the data before you make your search, so your searches are instantaneous. No lag, no waiting â€“ results as soon as you need them. We don't bother with API calls or really anything external to the site; it all comes down to how fast your browser can render the results!</p>

                        <div>
                            <p>Anyway, less of that boring stuff, go and enjoy the site! If you like it, you can donate to my fund here: <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=W24KWDR9GV7FJ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.paypal.com/donate</a></p>
